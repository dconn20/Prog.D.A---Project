#### OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************

For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.

Specifically, in this project you should:

• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.

• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.

• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.

• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set.

#### PACKAGES USED IN THIS PROJECT
************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
The following packages were used to run analysis for this project.

Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ - is the easiest way to perfrom Python data science machine learning on Linux, Windows and Mac OS.

Python https://www.python.org/downloads/ - An interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language

iPython https://ipython.org/ - it an interactive command-line terminal for Python.

Jupyter Notebook https://jupyter.org/ - is an open-source web application that allows the creation and sharing of documents that contains live code, equations, visualisations and narriative text

Numpy http://www.numpy.org/ - is the fundamental package for scientific computing within Python.

Pandas https://pandas.pydata.org/ - Python library used for for data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib.pylab https://matplotlib.org/ - Python library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations

Seaborn https://seaborn.pydata.org/ - Python data visualization library based on matplotlib

#### INSTRUCTIONS
*************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Once you install Anaconda, the packages listed above will also be installed.

First go to https://github.com/dconn20/Prog.D.A---Project.git and download the repository

Navigate to the correct folder on your terminal where you have saved the repository

You can now run the notebook by typing jupyter notebook in the command prompt

A window or tab should open in your default web browser. If this does not happen the command prompt output will provide a URL which you can copy and paste into your web browser to access jupyter notebook

Double click the jupyter notebook file and the notebook should open in a new tab

When opened select run all cells

Please note that certain cells must be run before others, such as importing the libraries
